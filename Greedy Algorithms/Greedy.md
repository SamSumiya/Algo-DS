A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. 
It does not worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result. 

This algorithm may not produce the best result for all the problems. 
It is always goes for the local best choice to produce the global best result. 

1. Greedy Choice Property 
If an optimal solution to the problem can be found by choosing the best choice at each step without 
reconsidering the previous steps once chosen, the problem can be solved using a greedy approach. 
This property is called greedy choice property.
